# Student-Performanc-Analysis
* This project “Student performance Analysis” provides us a simple interface for maintenance of student & subjects information. This software will generate summary report regarding student information and result, pass percentage of students in individual subjects of all academic years by using graphs and pie charts.
* The objective of this project is to allow the administrator of any organization to edit and find out the personal details of a student, allows the student to check his/her result and submit his details.
* It also allows everyone to check pass percentage of students in individual subjects of all available academic years and pass percentage of all subjects in all available
academic years.
* It’ll also facilitate keeping all the records of students, such as their roll number, first name, last name, gender, branch, mailing address, and marks obtained in various subjetcs etc.
* So all the information about an student will be available in a few seconds. All information can be stored and different operations can be performed on it through database. Some of the activities performed are submitting form by student, updating, searching and deleting records of students by admin etc.
* It can be used by educational institutes or colleges to maintain the records of students and pass percentage of subject easily. This application will greatly simplify and speed up the result preparation and management process.
